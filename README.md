Keypirinha Plugin: Kitty
=========

This plugin allows to launch KiTTY (either installed or portable) and KiTTY sessions directly via Keypirinha. It also supports `dir_mode` by KiTTY to load sessions from disk instead of registry. Please adjust the configuration accordingly if you want to use this mode.

The plugin will only add one catalog item to Keypirinha. This item has two functionalities:

1. You can start KiTTY by hitting `<ENTER>` on the KiTTY catalog item. 
2. To directly launch KiTTY sessions press `<TAB>` or `<SPACE>` on the KiTTY catalog item. Afterwards you can filter the existing sessions list by typing parts of the session names just like normal.


## Release Notes: ##

**V 1.0**
- First release of plugin.

**V 1.0.1**
- Small fix to avoid adding session suggestions to catalog on execution.
